        <h2>What is Diabetes?</h2>
        <p>Diabetes is a chronic health condition that occurs when the body cannot effectively regulate blood sugar
            (glucose) levels. Glucose is the primary source of energy for the body's cells, and its regulation is
            managed by a hormone called <strong>insulin</strong>, which is produced by the pancreas.</p>

        <h2>Types of Diabetes</h2>
        <h3>1. Type 1 Diabetes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cause:</strong> Autoimmune reaction where the immune system attacks insulin-producing cells in
                the pancreas.</li>
            <li><strong>Who It Affects:</strong> Often diagnosed in children or young adults, but can occur at any age.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Management:</strong> Requires daily insulin injections or the use of an insulin pump.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2. Type 2 Diabetes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cause:</strong> The body becomes resistant to insulin, or the pancreas does not produce enough
                insulin.</li>
            <li><strong>Who It Affects:</strong> More common in adults but increasingly diagnosed in children and teens
                due to obesity.</li>
            <li><strong>Management:</strong> Lifestyle changes (diet, exercise), medications, and sometimes insulin.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>3. Gestational Diabetes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cause:</strong> High blood sugar levels during pregnancy due to hormonal changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Who It Affects:</strong> Pregnant women; usually resolves after childbirth, but increases the
                risk of developing Type 2 diabetes later.</li>
            <li><strong>Management:</strong> Monitoring blood sugar, healthy diet, and exercise; sometimes insulin or
                medication.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>4. Prediabetes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cause:</strong> Blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not yet high enough for a Type 2
                diabetes diagnosis.</li>
            <li><strong>Management:</strong> Lifestyle changes to prevent progression to Type 2 diabetes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Symptoms of Diabetes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased thirst and hunger</li>
            <li>Frequent urination</li>
            <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
            <li>Fatigue</li>
            <li>Blurred vision</li>
            <li>Slow-healing wounds</li>
            <li>Frequent infections</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>In severe cases, untreated diabetes can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis (Type 1) or hyperosmolar
                hyperglycemic state (Type 2), both of which require immediate medical attention.</em></p>

        <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Type 1:</strong> Family history, genetics, autoimmune conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Type 2:</strong> Overweight or obesity, sedentary lifestyle, family history, age (45+),
                ethnicity (higher risk in African American, Hispanic, Native American, and Asian populations), high
                blood pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Gestational:</strong> Overweight, previous gestational diabetes, family history of Type 2
                diabetes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Complications</h2>
        <p>If not managed properly, diabetes can lead to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Heart disease</li>
            <li>Stroke</li>
            <li>Kidney damage (diabetic nephropathy)</li>
            <li>Eye damage (diabetic retinopathy)</li>
            <li>Nerve damage (diabetic neuropathy)</li>
            <li>Foot problems (ulcers, infections)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Management and Prevention</h2>
        <h3>1. Lifestyle Changes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Healthy, balanced diet with controlled carbohydrate intake.</li>
            <li>Regular physical activity.</li>
            <li>Weight management.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2. Medications</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Insulin therapy for Type 1 and sometimes Type 2 diabetes.</li>
            <li>Oral medications like Metformin for Type 2 diabetes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>3. Regular Monitoring</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Blood sugar levels using a glucose meter.</li>
            <li>Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider to monitor A1C levels, cholesterol, and blood pressure.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>4. Prevention</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Stay active and maintain a healthy weight.</li>
            <li>Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol.</li>
            <li>Eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Diabetes is a manageable condition with the right care and lifestyle adjustments. If you suspect you or
            someone else has symptoms of diabetes, consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment.</p>
